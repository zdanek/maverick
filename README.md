UAV Companion Computer System

Maverick is a system for creating, maintaining and controlling UAV Companion Computers.  The name Maverick reflects the initial main goal of interfacing Companion Computers to Flight Controllers through the Mavlink protocol, specifically ArduPilot (PX4 support planned).

Please see <a href='https://goodrobots.github.io/maverick/' target="maverick_docs">the documentation</a> for more info and how to install it.

What does Maverick do?
